--- Analyzing Mapping Coverage ---
Step 1: Getting a sample of unique raw codes from your data...
Analyzing 61343 unique raw codes...
Step 2: Building the mapping tables...
Step 3: Joining mapping tables to the sample codes...

--- MAPPING COVERAGE REPORT ---
Mapped by primary 'medcodes' list:        4235 (~6.9%)
Mapped by 'ReadcodeList' fallback:        18 (~0.0%)
Mapped by 'medcodes2' fallback:         4450 (~7.3%)
Fell back to just a Read Code:         52640 (~85.8%)
Remained completely unmapped:              0 (~0.0%)
